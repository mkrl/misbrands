(there's more!)

Inspired by Sam Beckham's legendary [JavaScript sticker]( https://samdbeckham.gitlab.io/javascript_sticker/)

## FAQ: 

#### Can I print these?
Of course, that's why those are here.

#### Can I buy these?
Yes, you can! Not from me, but from any custom sticker vendor of your choice, or from this (unaffiliated) [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1133836260/cursed-programming-sticker-sheet).

#### Will there be more?
Unlikely but still possible.
